### How many SlimeVR trackers do I need?

- Do you want to cover just chest or hip or both? -> 1 or 2/1+1
>From here, if you answer no to any below then stop at previous and thats your optimal choice.
- Minimum 5+0 gives you leg and body (not so accurate body).
- Do you need more accurate body hip tracking? -> 5+1
- Do you need with feet tracking? -> 5+3
- Do you need with elbow tracking? -> 7+3
- Do you need full mocap tracking? -> 12 to 20
